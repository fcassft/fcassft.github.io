<h2>Summary of Benefits of FCASS</h2>
1. Standalone Cost Allocation solution including budget allocation with useful set of reports<br>
2. Provides solution to maintain Cost Allocation Model and Financial data<br>
3. Simple interfacing using CSV files<br>
4. Small and very simple installation, can be run from USB key<br>
5. Quick to start running<br>
6. Fast <br>
7. Free to use for Educational usage<br>
8. Runs on Windows 32 bit and 64 bit from Windows XP and upwards (including Windows 10)<br>
9. No dependencies on other software<br>
10. Internet access is NOT required. No information is read from, or sent to internet.<br>

<h2 id="overview">Cost Allocation Architecture</h2>
<p>Cost Allocation consists of three parts Data Capture, Allocation and Allocation Reporting and Final Reporting.<br>
FCASS provides a simple Data Capture component (FCASSE editing) and Allocation and Allocation Reporting (FCASSA).<br><br>
<img src="Overview.jpg" alt="Overview Diagram" width="696" height="205">
<br><br>
<b>Data Capture and Maintenance</b><br> 
The cost allocation solution has four different types of data to be captured or maintained<br>
a. Dimension data – e.g. Product Hierarchy, Customer Hierarchy, Cost/Profit Centre Hierarchy, General Ledger Account Hierarchy, Resource Hierarchy, Activity Hierarchy, Location Hierarchy<br>
b. Model Structure – i.e. Stages, Cost Pool Groups, Cost Pools, selection rules<br>
c. Allocation Rules and Measures – i.e. Allocation Base, Measure Data e.g. number of returns of product<br>
d. Transaction data – Financial transactions recorded against dimensions<br>
<br> This function is performed by program FCASSE (FCASS Edit).<br>
<br>
<b>Allocation and Allocation Reporting</b><br>
Using data captured and provided as files, the Cost Allocation and Allocation Reporting sub system runs the cost allocation model and also allocation reports. The allocation reports are used to confirm that the allocation has run successfully and include reports that can show the traceability of the allocation.<br>
<br>This function is performed by program FCASSA (FCASS Allocation).<br>
<br>
<b>Final Reporting</b><br>
Final Reporting takes the results of the allocation and produces reports in required presentation formats which may include graphics and online drill down capability for management reporting.<br>
<br>
FCASS does not provide a solution for this. A cheap solution may be to use an end user reporting solution such as Excel (perhaps with Powerpivot) which uses as input CSV files created by the allocation reports.<br>
